# ROS 2 with ONNX Runtime

<p align="center"><img width="50%" src="docs/images/ONNX_Runtime_logo_dark.png" /></p>

[ONNX Runtime](https://github.com/microsoft/onnxruntime) is an open source inference engine for ONNX Models.
ONNX Runtime Execution Providers (EPs) enables the execution of any ONNX model using a single set of inference APIs that provide access to the best hardware acceleration available.

In simple terms, developers no longer need to worry about the nuances of hardware specific custom libraries to accelerate their machine learning models.
This repository demonstrates that by enabling the same code with ROS 2 to run on different hardware platforms using their respective AI acceleration libraries for optimized execution of the ONNX model.
